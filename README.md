# MultiBabiVerse

This project aims to study the relationship between prematurity and brain development.
Leveraging Multiverse Analysis to ensure the robustness of the findings

## Description

The current project aims to study the difference between efficient and segregated working modalities of the brain in premature neonates.
To achieve this goal, fMRI data from 301 infants was used to conduct the following analyses. Then, individual measures of segregation and integration are estimated.
To ensure the replicability of the findings, and gain insight into the robustness of the effect, many alternative analyses are carried out.
These analyses include 1152 different ways to process the data, each being a unique combination of the following decisions:
* Global Signal Regression - yes or no
* Connectivity measure - correlation, partial correlation or covariance
* Negative Correlations - keep, absolute or to zero
* Threshold - high to low
* Connectivity Weigths - binarize or normalize

Through different dimensionality reduction methods, the similarities between approaches are visualized in a 2D space.
The prediction accuracy of each approach is calculated using simple spline regression with variable polynomial degree to observe the increased explained R2.
